			<!--Introduction-->
			<h2 id="introduction"> Introduction </h2>

			<p> Paint is divided into three main parts: Toolbar, Taskbar and the Canvas where you draw. </p><br>
			
			<h3> Tool Bar </h3>
			<p> The Tool Bar is the place where you select the Tool, adjust Colours and tool Size.</p>

			<h3> Canvas </h3>
			<p> The Canvas is the place where you draw </p>
			
			<!--Tools-->
			<h2 id="tools"> Tools </h2>
			<p> Paint offers you 7 amazing tools: Basic Brush, Smooth Brush, Spray, MultiColour, Laser, Eraser and Delete All. </p>
			
			<h3> Brush: Basic </h3>
			<p>Basic Brush is a normal brush which you use to draw.</p>
			
			<h3> Brush: Smooth </h3>
			<p>Smooth Brush is same as Basic Brush but it has a smooth movement(delay movement) which makes easier to draw some shapes.</p>
			
			<h3> Spray </h3>
			<p>Spray is a tool which sprays on the Canvas which helps you to make colour textures</p>
			
			<h3> Multicolour </h3>
			<p>Multicolour is a special tool which continuesly changes the pen colour when draw. This tool helps for colourful art.</p>
			
			<h3> Laser </h3>
			<p>Laser is a simple tool which is used to point something. This can be used to point out something in the drawing while presenting a drawing or an information.</p>
			
			<h3> Eraser </h3>
			<p>Eraser is just a simple tool which is used to erase.</p>
			
			<h3> Delete All </h3>
			<p>Delete All just clears all the drawing in the canvas. Don't worry if you mistakely clicked the Delete All button, it first asks confirmation and then deletes the drawing. <b>Note:</b> When you delte the drawing, then you can't undo this action.</p>
